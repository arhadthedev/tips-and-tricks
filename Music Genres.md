House:
- [Why does 80s music sound so good?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jav5xMqBWeY) - In the 80's there was a huge emphasis on the relationship between chord progressions and melody, almost like an orchestra, and how a small change in a chord (as demonstrated here) could affect the emotion of the melody, it really was true composing. Nowadays I don't think artists know what a chord progression is let alone how to write one, music has become simplistic in a bad way (a beat and a couple of 'blip' sounds)
