## Japanese 5S

[5S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5S_(methodology)) is about workplace organization:
- sort
	- check all items in a location and evaluate whether or not their presence at the location is useful or necessary
	- remove unnecessary items as soon as possible. Place those that cannot be removed immediately in a red tag area so that they are easy to remove later on
	- keep the working floor clear of materials except for those that are in use for production
- set in order
	- arrange work stations in such a way that all tooling/equipment is in close proximity, in an easy to reach spot and in a logical order adapted to the work performed. Place components according to their uses, with the frequently used components being nearest to the workplace
	- arrange all necessary items so that they can be easily selected for use. Make it easy to find and pick up necessary items
	- assign fixed locations for items. Use clear labels, marks or hints so that items are easy to return to the correct location and so that it is easy to spot missing items
- shine
	- clean the workplace and equipment on a daily basis, or at another appropriate (high frequency) cleaning interval
	- inspect the workplace and equipment while cleaning
	- *when in place, anyone not familiar to the environment must be able to detect any problems within 15 metres (50 ft) in 5 seconds*
- standardize
	- develop a work structure that will support the new practices and make it part of the daily routine
	- ensure everyone knows their responsibilities of performing the sorting, organizing and cleaning
	- use photos and visual controls to help keep everything as it should be
	- review the status of 5S implementation regularly using audit checklists
- self-discipline
	- organize training sessions
	- perform regular audits to ensure that all defined standards are being implemented and followed
	- implement improvements whenever possible. Worker inputs can be very valuable for identifying improvements

## Mistake-proofing

[Benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poka-yoke#Benefits_of_poka-yoke_implementation):

- less time spent on training workers
- elimination of many operations related to quality control
- unburdening of operators from repetitive operations
- promotion of the work improvement-oriented approach and actions
- a reduced number of rejects
- immediate action when a problem occurs
- 100% built-in quality control
- preventing bad products from reaching customers
- detecting mistakes as they occur
- eliminating defects before they occur

## Lean startup

- minimum viable product
- continuous deployment
- A/B testing
- build-measure-learn loop (emphasizes speed as a critical ingredient)

## Six Sigma

For starters, it is about three directions that can be achieved with no extra guideline:

- continuous efforts to achieve stable and predictable process results (e.g., by reducing process variation) are of vital importance to business success
- manufacturing and business processes have characteristics that can be defined, measured, analyzed, improved, and controlled
- achieving sustained quality improvement requires commitment from the entire organization, particularly from top-level management

Tools:

- [shadow board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_board) - have the outlines of a work station's tools marked on them, allowing operators to identify quickly which tools are in use or missing

## Plan-Do-Check-Adjust

[PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA) is about :

- plan - establish objectives and processes required to deliver the desired results
- do - carry out the objectives from the previous step
- check - the data and results gathered from the do phase are evaluated. Data is compared to the expected outcomes to see any similarities and differences. The testing process is also evaluated to see if there were any changes from the original test created during the planning phase. If the data is placed in a chart it can make it easier to see any trends if the plan–do–check–act cycle is conducted multiple times. This helps to see what changes work better than others and if said changes can be improved as well via gap analysis
- adjust - where a process is improved. Records from the "do" and "check" phases help identify issues with the process. These issues may include problems, non-conformities, opportunities for improvement, inefficiencies, and other issues that result in outcomes that are evidently less-than-optimal. Root causes of such issues are investigated, found, and eliminated by modifying the process. Risk is re-evaluated. At the end of the actions in this phase, the process has better instructions, standards, or goals. Planning for the next cycle can proceed with a better baseline. Work in the next do phase should not create a recurrence of the identified issues; if it does, then the action was not effective

## Agile Manifesto

Principles:
- satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
- welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. *From me: it means (1) modular approach for easy reconfiguration, extension, and contraction; it also means (2) no regret in removing functionality so we initially keep it simple and fast-added
- deliver working software frequently, from a  couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
- business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project
- uild projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done
- the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation
- working software is the primary measure of progress (*from me: it means that each and every commit must be buildable and working*)
- agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely
- continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
- simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential
- the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- at regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Waste

According to [Toyota's (Ohno's) Seven Forms of Waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muda_(Japanese_term)#Toyota's_(Ohno's)_Seven_Forms_of_Waste):
- transport - every time a product is touched or moved unnecessarily there is a risk that it could be damaged, lost, delayed, etc. as well as being a cost for no added value. Transporting does not add value to the product, i.e. is not a transformation for which the consumer is willing to pay moving products that are not actually required to perform an operation
- invertory - whether in the form of raw materials, work-in-progress, or finished goods, represents a capital outlay that cannot yet produce an income. The longer a product sits in one of these states, the more it contributes to waste. The smooth, continuous flow of work through each process ensures excess amounts of inventory are minimized
- motion - in contrast to transportation, which refers to damage and transaction costs associated with moving the product, motion refers to the damage and costs inflicted on what creates the product. This can include wear and tear for equipment, repetitive strain injuries for workers or unnecessary downtime
- waiting - whenever the product is not in transportation or being processed, it is waiting (typically in a queue). In traditional processes, a large part of an individual product's life is spent waiting to be worked on
- overproduction - мaking more of a product than is required results in several forms of waste, typically caused by production in large batches. The customer's needs often change over the time it takes to produce a larger batch. Over-production has been described as the worst kind of waste
- over processing - вoing more to a product than is required by the end-customer results in it taking longer and costing more to produce. This also includes using components that are more precise, complex, expensive or higher quality than absolutely required
- defects - Having to discard or rework a product due to earlier defective work or components results in additional cost and delays
