> For an easy +12, I recommend the "simplecv" LaTeX document class -- it's included somewhere in the full TexLive distribution. That Computer Modern font on a resume or CV, combined with judicious use of small caps, looks _deadly_ serious.

> And while I’m on it, anonymous email accounts and AOL accounts just don’t send a good message. They won’t exactly disqualify you since so many people use them, but crazydood2004 at hotmail.com does not really impress me as much as name at alumni.something.edu.

> In most of the English speaking world it is not considered polite to open letters to a Mr. Joel Spolsky by writing “Dear Spolsky.” One might write “Dear Mr. Spolsky,” or “Dear sir,” or perhaps, “Hi Joel!” But “Dear Spolsky” is usually followed by some story about embezzled funds and needing to borrow my bank account.

> **Tip #4: Avoid Weasel Words**
  >
> Weasel Words are impressive-sounding verbs that make it sound like you did something useful, when in fact all you did was snork down chocolates from the big candy bowl in the conference room while other people did all the actual work.
  >
> "Participated" is the all-time champion Weasel Word. As an example of just how weaselly it is, consider this: I can say truthfully that I participated in the Gulf War. I even received a medal for it. The actual _form_ of my participation involved watching it on CNN; I happened to be active duty Navy at the time but wasn't on tour. But I "participated" so I got a medal, despite the fact that I probably couldn't identify the Persian Gulf on a map. 
  >
> \[...\]
  >
> Given that you can participate in something without doing much or having any real impact, the word "participate" becomes a semantic sink: it sucks all meaning out of a paragraph, nullifying any deductions we can make about your actual contribution. If any form of "participated" appears in a paragraph describing something you did, experienced resume screeners will simply draw a big red line through that paragraph and move on.
 > 
> "Proposed" is another Weasel Word, unless it's immediately followed by a claim of bona-fide work, such as "...and implemented". There's a certain type of candidate who drifts from job to job and produces nothing but proposals. This can mean that the person doesn't like to do real work, or that nobody ever listens to the person, but either way it's not good.
  >
> One big class of Weasel Words is the "stalker" category, including "analyzed", "studied", "learned", "observed", "watched" and their ilk. Nobody wants to hire you based on your extensive experience with observing work occurring. If all you did was analyze stuff, assuming it wasn't some sort of rigorous statistical analysis worth bragging about, then just take that whole item out of your tech resume.
  >
> Resume screeners keep an eye out for non-weasel words, aka Productivity Words. These are words that you can't weasel out of when someone asks you about them. The best are synonyms of "got real stuff done", including "coded", "implemented", "developed", "delivered", and "launched".
  >
> It's perfectly OK to use "designed", as long as you follow it up with a Productivity Word. If you design something without implementing it, then it's just a synonym for "Proposed". If you prefer to design things that other people ultimately implement, then you're quite possibly outstanding material for a company full of kneebiters. But a real tech company like Amazon or eBay or Microsoft or whoever isn't going to hire you, because they can find plenty of people who can both design things _and_ implement them.

> **Tip #5: Avoid Wank Words**  
  
Wank Words are words that inflate your perceived importance (e.g. using "architected" rather than "designed"), or words that have simply become synonyms, such as "Rational UML Process", for the so-called work done by people who sit on their asses and don't know how to code anymore.  
  
Wank Words are worse than just devoid of content; they're active indicators of total inactivity. Resume screeners either delete Wank Words or replace them with the word "wank" (e.g., "Certified Wank Master"), which makes the resume a lot easier to scan.  
  
"Advocate" is a common wank word, when it refers to a title or position. If it's a verb then it's just a weasel word, but if you think it's your title, then you've inflated yourself into Wanker territory. Either way, if you're walking around advocating stuff, it means you're not working. Also, it means nobody listens to you, because if you possessed actual leadership, people would just do what you recommended and then you wouldn't need advocate it anymore. So "advocate" just means "wanker".  
  
"Consultant" is often another absolutely outstanding synonym for "wanker". Now let me just add, before I get stabbed to death by eager members of the heavily armed Consultant Industry, that _some_ consultants are great. The problem is that the odds are completely stacked against you _in tech resume screening_. It's like fast-food experience when applying to be a waiter at a fancy restaurant. It _might_ have helped you hone your waiter skills, but the odds are against it, and a lot of the art of resume screening is about weighing odds.  
  
The problem with "consultant" is that it has two meanings. It can either mean "person who was hired on a contract basis to fill a coding need in the organization", or it can mean "person hired to 'consult', aka 'wank', because the hiring organization is too clueless to solve their own problems and too incompetent to retain even one full-time staff member capable of helping them, so they turn to paid self-help." When you see the word on a resume, it can be hard to distinguish which kind it is.  
  
The all-time worst Wank Word is probably "Methodologist". It will definitely get your resume circulated around at tech companies, but not for the reasons you were hoping. Any sort of amusing synonym for "Methodologist", such as Scrum Master, generally has the same effect.  
  
Wank Words are a bit like the adjectives on restaurant menus — meaningless fluff words added in an attempt to make the dish sound tasty. You can get a much clearer idea of what the hell it is that you're contemplating eating if you take all the adjectives out, including nouns and noun-strings that serve as adjectives. For instance, _House Cured Spice Rubbed Apple Smoked Line Caught Columbia River Coho Salmon_, when all the Wank Words are removed, becomes "Salmon", which is of course the only part of the description that you're actually eating. Depending on how you feel about what that winds up being, you can replace all the adjectives with either "icky" or "yummy", e.g. "Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy Salmon", or "Icky icky icky icky icky icky icky icky Eggplant."  
  
Hence, many wank-filled resumes wind up looking, after the screeners have marked them up a bit, like this: "Senior wanker wanking for the Wank-Wank Institute of Wankology on the wank wank wank project during which I wanked successfully with seven other wanky wankers."  
  
Well, "senior" is also kind of a wank word, but you get the idea.

**Tip #6: Don't be a Certified Loser**  
  
Don't ever, _ever_ use the word "certified" your resume. It's far and away one of the most prominent red flags in resume screening, bordering on a dead-giveaway round-file 86-that-bad-boy no-review-required situation, if you know what I mean. (If you don't know what I mean, well, you know the old saying about not knowing who the sucker is at the poker table.)  
  
Certification is for the weak. It's something that flags you as a technician when you really want to be an engineer. If you want to be a television repairman, you can become certified in TV repair. If you want to work for Sony and design their next big-screen TV, then you clearly don't need a busy-working-adults course on how to repair the fugging things.  
  
Same goes for tech certification. It means you had to take a course to learn something you could have read in a book. If you know something, just say you know it, and then be prepared to answer questions about it during your phone screens and/or interviews. If you feel compelled to add that you're certified in said skill, it's just broadcasting that you lack confidence in your own self-assessments, which doesn't help you in the slightest.  
  
Seriously. Take all mentions of certifications off your tech resume. It's actively hurting your chances of getting an interview.  
  
**Tip #7: Don't say "expert" unless you really mean it**  
  
The term "expert" makes experts' eyes glow red. It doesn't bother me personally, but I know enough interviewers who care vastly about it that I'm advising you to steer clear. If you say you're an expert in something, many interviewers take it to mean you claim to have a bigger penis than they do, metaphorically speaking of course, and they're going to pull out their still highly metaphorical measuring stick during the interview and size you up. I employ this metaphor in its most gender-neutral possible interpretation, needless to say.  
  
A friend of mine at Amazon once told me that he takes resumes that list "expertise" and he tells the candidate something along these lines: "Wow! You don't often find true experts in fields like this. I feel like I've found a kindred spirit here. I don't often do this, but I'm going to pick one of these technologies you're an expert at, and we're doing to do an incredibly deep technical dive on the subject. But before I start, is there anything you want to take off the resume?"  
  
He says it's like truth serum. (Hi, H.B.!)

**Tip #9: Don't bore us to death**  
  
Consider this resume statement:  
  

  * designed and developed runtime library code to emulate  
   MS-DOS and BIOS calls on a variety of Unix platforms.  This  
   enables binary-ported DOS application programs such as Quicken  
   and Microsoft Word to run under a commercial emulator on Unix  
   platforms.  This enables users who do not currently have access  
   to a DOS machine, but who have blah blah BLAH lather rinse repeat.

  
All it needs is the first sentence; we can deduce the rest.
